# todolist-vue

ToDoList in ***Vue.js***, ***JavaScript*** and ***HTML with CSS***. **[[rep](https://github.com/eugene-serb/todolist-vue/), [site](https://eugene-serb.github.io/todolist-vue/)]**

This is a simple to-do list web application. Helps you organize tasks and plan projects.

There is a few files:
1. ***index.html*** – a file with a form and another elements.
2. ***css/todolist.css*** – styles for the todolist application, but for now some of them are in the main styles on [this page](https://eugene-serb.github.io/).
3. ***js/todolist.js*** – all scripts in the todolist application.
4. ***img/%file name%.svg*** – all application icons.
